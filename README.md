The project deals mainly with "Monom" (For example "2X^3) and "polynom" (For example "2X^3+2X).

The "Monom" department has the following functions:
Different constructors, Monom calculation, derivative, addition of Monom to Monom, multiplication of Monoms, And so forth.

The "Polynom" functions include:
Different constructors, addition of Polynom to Polynom, addition of Polynom to Polynom, subtraction of Polynom from Polynom,
multiplication of Polynoms, comparison of Polynom, computation of area, derivative, And so forth.
